# [\#41 Issue](https://github.com/acteng/overview/issues/41) `open`: Hook up AMAT

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1664407?u=bb93d80353239826daf91ba671c44f180e344097&v=4" width="50">[dabreegster](https://github.com/dabreegster) opened issue at [2023-05-25 15:37](https://github.com/acteng/overview/issues/41):

In a call with Adrian, he brought up the idea of running AMAT from ATIP. This is also an idea I've heard earlier. AMAT is https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1102781/active-model-appraisal-toolkit-user-guidance.pdf (I dunno if this is the latest version of this doc!)

Skimming through the doc, we can automate many of the input steps, like area lookup, trip count before from PCT. Maybe we can develop easy methods for the "comparative study" option of the "Number of trips with the proposed intervention" part.

We could generate the current Excel file with the values prefilled, and also show a user-friendly summary in the web browser.

# [\#40 Issue](https://github.com/acteng/overview/issues/40) `open`: A local authority name to code mapper

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20887250?u=e9b26a3a637065c8c3f2fd6066ebd87dc8f0466e&v=4" width="50">[Sparrow0hawk](https://github.com/Sparrow0hawk) opened issue at [2023-05-09 16:42](https://github.com/acteng/overview/issues/40):

It looks like we may have to routinely map local authority names to the 3 letter codes used within active travel England. It would be very nice to develop a simple tool that does this mapping simply and robustly.

I envisage it taking at least two arguments: a version and an input string. The version would map to a file (internal to package) that contains local authority name-code mappings where each time it has changed we increment a new version number (would recommend using CalVer). The input string would be for a local authority name on which we either exact (or fuzzy match) to a code. Values that don't match would return NA or None.

Correct, quicker than clicking around on the UI. The more that can be done at the command line the better!

Crit   Issue # | Critical Issue | Process / Data   Required | TH Comment | Ease of   Computation (0 hard, 10 very easy) | TH Comment
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
6 | Risk   of crossing conflicts | 1)   Is the traffic flow > 8000vpd?     2) Are there formal crossings present?     3) What is the largest gap between formal crossings? If over 400m then   critical. | There   is also another critical scenario for roads with <8000vpd which will be   very hard to compute ("Are any obvious pedestrian desire lines blocked   by parked cars?")          For formal crossings definition (see attached Crossings diagram) | 8 | If   we can identify the relevant crossing types and get flow data, this might be   fairly straightforward.
11 | Clear   walking spaces free of obstructions and furniture, reducing risk of   pedestrians walking in the carriageway. | 1)   Is the clear (unobsctructed) footway width <1.0m?     2) Is the clear (unobstructed) footway width <1.5m for over 6m?     3) If yes to either of those, then critical | Absolute   minimum acceptable is 1m but only for a length of 6m. Desire minimum is 1.5m. Higher thresholds if footways are crowded. | 8 |  
7 | Standard   of crossing facility | 1)   Is the traffic flow > 8000vpd?     2) Are there two lanes of traffic to cross?     3) What form of crossing is provided? If uncontrolled then critical.          A) Identify signal junctions     B) Are there any arms with no green man for pedestrians? If yes then   critical | Two   separate checks: For links it's 1,2,3; for junctions it's A,B.          There is also a 'gaps in traffic' element to this but for ease I would   ignore that (with Brian's permission)          For uncontrolled crossings definition (see attached Crossings diagram) | 7 | The   link check is more straightforward than the junction check
8 | Speed   of traffic (where cyclists are not separated or pedestrians crossing   uncontrolled) | 1)   Are cyclists mixed with traffic? AND/OR Do pedestrians cross   uncontrolled?     2) If yes, is the 85th percentile speed over 60km/h? |   | 7 | Is   85th percentile speed data available?          Identifying whether peds cross uncontrolled might be challenging
9 | Total   volume of traffic (where cyclists are not separated or pedestrians cross   uncontrolled) | 1)   Are cyclists mixed with traffic? AND/OR Do pedestrians cross   uncontrolled?     2) If yes, is the total volume of traffic > 1000vpd? |   | 7 | Identifying   whether peds cross uncontrolled might be challenging
13 | Crossing   angle (between cyclist desire line and tram tracks) | 1)   Is there a tramline?     2) Are cyclists expected to cross the tramline at an angle of less than 60   degrees? |   | 7 |  
3 | Collision   alongside or from behind | 1)   Are cyclists mixed with traffic in nearside lanes?     2) If yes is the lane width between 3.25m and 3.9m? |   | 6 | Depends   on accuracy of satellite / other data for lane widths?
5 | Conflict   with kerbside activity (parking, loading, risk of 'dooring' and bus stops) | 1)   Is there a cycle facility next to parking/loading?     2) Is there a 0.5m buffer between them? |   | 6 | Depends   on accuracy of satellite / other data for lane widths?
12 | Effective   width next to tram line on a straight run | 1)   Is there a tramline?     2) Is there <2.4m between the kerb and the tram rail and are cyclists   expected to cycle in that space? If yes then critical |   | 6 |  
1 | Conflict   with motor traffic at side roads / priority junctions | 1)   Identify side roads / priority junctions     2) Are cyclist and ped movements protected?     3) If not, what are the turning counts (motor vehicles per day) | Protected   = zebra crossing, continuous footway, modal filter, priority maintained for   cyclists          (2) is basically "are there red movements if a JAT check were   performed?" | 5 | I   imagine (1) is easy, (2) is hard, and (3) depends on what flow data is   available.
2 | Conflict   with motor traffic at signal controlled junctions and roundabouts | 1)   Identify signal control junctions / roundabouts     2) Are cyclist and ped movements protected/separated in time/space?     3) Turning counts (motor vehicles per day) clashing with any unprotected   ped/cycle movements | (2)   is basically "are there red movements if a JAT check were   performed?" | 3 | Same   comments as crit issue #1 but these junctions are more complex so (2) is   hard.
10 | Required   crossing speed (risk of pedestrians coming into conflict with traffic) | 1)   Locate signalled pedestrian crossing     2) How long is the crossing?     3) How much time is there for the stage?     4) What speed to peds have to move to get across in time? If faster than   1.2m/s then critical. | This   is actually quite a rare critical as most crossings are designed for 1.2m/s   or slower. | 3 | Finding   stage times might be hard, everything else can probably be approximated   through satelite imagery?
4 | Trip   hazard | 1)   Are the level differences of greater than 20mm in the walking   environment?     2) Is there any colour contrast to help identify them? |   | 2 | Robin   mentioned LIDAR but can see this one being challenging!
14 | Cycle   surface defects: non cycle friendly ironworks, raised/sunken covers/gullies | 1)   Are there any major defects, such as those listed, in the cycle space? |   | 1 |  
15 | Pedestrian   surface defects: non flush tables, misleading tactile information, cracked   pacing, slip-risks present from covers, steep slopes | 1)   Are there any major defects, such as those listed, in the pedestrian space? |   | 1 |

Goal: TBC. My thoughts are Long term: to port full functionality of Excel-based tools into a web app architecture. Short term: simply find the critical issues and generating outputs that show where they are could be key.

I need to get more details, but roughly something like A/B Street's ability to generate all the possible turning movements, then let inspections manually score each movement by criteria I don't yet understand. We could have a simple web map UI, click an intersection, generate movements for it, let people rank

Currently we have

- github.com/acteng
- github.com/Active-Travel-England

Having just moved atip to the new org, I'm annoyed at the long and clunky name of the latter org.

Current plan: 

- [x] Rename acteng to actenglabs, following the IMO good example of rOpenSci: https://github.com/ropenscilabs
- [x] Rename Active-Travel-England to acteng, a name I really rate

Another advantage of having 2 orgs: it will allow us to keep the official account primarily for users who have .gov.uk accounts.

Input: GeoJSON lines representing trips from A to B. They might have arbitrary properties, usually representing something like number of people doing that trip, broken by mode. This comes from some kind of travel demand model / jittering process.

Final output: Segments in the route network with aggregated properties. A segment should never be "longer" than an original OSM way, but it'll often by "smaller" (between two nodes in the way).

The routing implementation should be pluggable, letting us quickly swap out Valhalla, OSRM, OTP, etc running locally or remotely. The goal will be speed for big areas and inputs, of course.

Walking using the "most likely route somebody would pick assuming streets today" is the highest priority. Adjusting routing preferences and modifying the street network (making something nicer, drawing new bridges) would also be important.

From anywhere but yes, pre-exisiting road-widths datasets already exist in OS products, so that would be my first port of call. If we get pre-calculated widths from OS we would need to go through a process to open derived datasets and I'm in conversations to help make that happen.

Next step: properly engage with inspections team on what they need.

There is, however, substantial prior art here with several projects. Each of these has limitations as they relate to ATE objectives.

- https://counterpointapp.org/ an app used previously by colleagues that can be used to manually add data on number of people passing a point by different modes, also has substantial amount of data which can be requested
- https://telraam.net/ which allows citizens to install low cost camera based counters

Imagine a web app where you load two different GeoJSON files. The app shows you interactively explore the difference between the two -- what's been added, removed, changed, split, merged? The changes could be at the geometry level -- maybe a route has been slightly offset, or extended / trimmed. Or at the property level -- there've been additions/removals/changes at the JSON level there.

This is a pretty general-purpose idea, but there are a few immediate use cases:

1) I have two versions of an ATIP scheme, and I want to compare them. Maybe they represent the same scheme with one being a more recently edited copy, and I want to understand the changes since last time. Or maybe they're two competing / diverging ideas.
2) Say we extract some **existing** walking/cycling infra from OSM, like cycle Advanced Stop Lines, or signalized crossings, and show that as a contextual layer in ATIP. Later we grab fresh OSM data and repeat this extract. There'll be some diff, and manually checking what's happened would be very useful.

As an idea for implementation, I would break the problem into a smaller first step: assume every geojson feature has a unique ID that's stable between the two files. We can first focus on the UI of showing the diff between these features. Then we can remove that assumption, and try to figure out when two features should count as the same (maybe modified) or different. [Map matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_matching) is a very related problem.

Contextual layers in ATIP could emphasize nearby POIs -- shops, public spaces, big transport hubs, greenspace, etc. We should think through how to visualize this, and how much we could auto-score new routes drawn based on what types of amenities it passes by. We can also think about this in context of improving access to amenities.

See https://dabreegster.github.io/talks/tds_seminar_synthpop/slides.html#/trip-attractor-tables-for-destinations for very vague notes about using this kind of data with a travel demand modeling. Instead of equally weighting a corner store and a big supermarket for the activity of grocery shopping, we could maybe use some kind of ML (if we have data on what types of shops people actually visit?) to tune weights more specifically.

At the ATI visit today this was flagged as a priority. The current situation:

- Historic footpaths, many of which have been in use for hundreds of years, must be maintained by land owners by law and they are used by people who know where they are based on local knowledge or Ordnance Survey data.
- There is essentially zero data on the attributes of footpaths. The only way to know if a footpath is blocked or unpassable or unpleasant to use (e.g. muddy, thorns covering crossing points, stiles not working) is to go there.

This project idea is new and the scope needs to be tied down but it would like involve:

- [ ] Map existing data on footpaths
- [ ] Assess gaps in open data, primarily OpenStreetMap, where official routes that are mapped in OS are not in OSM
- [ ] Crowd source updates to the data, e.g. via a progressive web app, and promotion by ATE, to do targetted mapping to fill the gaps in OSM
- [ ] Use the data!
  - Public facing visualisation
  - Incorporation into LayerMapper project TBC
  - Incorporation into ATIP
  - Routing for leisure routes

Worth checking around with StreetComplete and similar projects; the OSM community has had a big emphasis on assessing [surface](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:surface) quality and accessibility of paths for cargo bikes and such.

Number of people, vehicle ownership, index of multiple deprivation, number of dependents per household, and any mobility impairment info... at finest granularity available.

Plenty of awesome ideas for visualization from ONS, like https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth?oa=E00173740.

I've started this at https://github.com/dabreegster/popgetter/. I don't want to limit the technical solution to the UK, but instead transform data from other countries into a common format. That's less important for the ATE part, but something to keep in mind.

# [\#10 Issue](https://github.com/acteng/overview/issues/10) `open`: Calculate building-to-building road width
**Labels**: `project idea`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1664407?u=bb93d80353239826daf91ba671c44f180e344097&v=4" width="50">[dabreegster](https://github.com/dabreegster) opened issue at [2023-03-13 12:12](https://github.com/acteng/overview/issues/10):

Maybe if OS road width data is unavailable or insufficient, in dense areas, we can come up with a basic guess just from OSM data. Start with a road center-line, and project it left and right until we hit some building (or park or body of water). It'd be useful to compare results from this to anything higher quality from OS.

I started playing around with this at https://github.com/dabreegster/osm2svelte. The vector tiles loaded anyway for rendering can be used to grab building polygons (and probably road polylines too), making it convenient to iterate on this problem in JS, if that's the useful tech stack.

After sketching a route in ATIP, an important question is "will it fit" -- what is the available road width along the route? Focusing on "pinch points" is important -- where is the available space the narrowest, and how long does that last? The Inclusive Mobility guide and/or LTN 120 describe some requirements/best practices here... something like "going down to 1.5m cycle lane width is OK if it's for less than 100m".

So the idea is to start from vector curb data from OS mastermap or similar, and a route polyline, and check width along the route.

This could possibly be a single implementation in Rust, with bindings to R / Python / whatever else is useful. It could make a nice Rust learning project, since it's porting existing logic, fairly simple in terms of input and output, etc.

This is more of an ATIP feature request but putting here as may be worth building as a standalone modular component:

>  Do we have any plans to develop apps/software to geolocate photos? I'm just thinking for our inspections it would be useful to take photos whilst on site that we can attach notes to that are accurately Geolocated when reviewing in the office. Is it something we could integrate with ATIP? I used to use Survey 123 and GIS to record this sort of info.

FYI @dabreegster

I think most off-the-shelf smartphones will tag location when you take a photo normally, unless it's been disabled. I bet there are photo viewing apps out there that'll show things on a map; we can have a look around. Would it be useful to maybe have a layer in ATIP to see little markers on the map where geolocated photos have been uploaded?

For sure, and CycleStreets' PhotoMap does a good job of that already, we could ask to integrate via their API.

Some prior work: https://github.com/itsleeds/cyclability

The goal of this miniproject, part of #3, is to generate estimates of broadly defined cyclability. There are at least three definitions of how conducive to cycling different places and segments of roads and travel networks are:

- [Level of Traffic Stress](https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress) (LTS)
- [Bikeability](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/cycletraining/article/ct20110111-cycletraining-What-is-Bikeability-0) levels, which rates infrastructure based on the level of training needed to feel comfortable:
Level 1 teaches basic bike-handling skills in a controlled traffic-free environment.
Level 2 teaches trainees to cycle planned routes on minor roads, offering a real cycling experience.
Level 3 ensures trainees are able to manage a variety of traffic conditions and is delivered on busier roads with advanced features and layouts
- CycleStreets’s [Quietness rating](https://www.cyclestreets.net/help/journey/howitworks/#quietness) from 1 (very unpleasant for cycling) to 100 (the quietest)

What should this be? A Python package, R package, Rust crate, set of scripts, report or other? To discuss! @dabreegster @Sparrow0hawk 

My thinking: low level foundation to be used as building block could be handy and Rust seems good for that.
